// You're given an array of numbers
// You need to find the highest possible product you can find with three numbers in the array

/* More explanation for the confused */
// imagine that you have the following array
const exampleArray = [18, 97, 2, 9, 3, 0, 26, 0, 26, 15, 5, 18, 43];

// from looking at it at first: 
// Question? Can you tell which numbers will create the greatest number when multiplied against one another?
// Answer: It's the largest three numbers you can find.
// 97, 26, 43
// Can you solve for this example alone?
// Hint, you had to find unique triplets in the last problem.


// Think of this as an exercise
