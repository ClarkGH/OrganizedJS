// ES2015: Backtick Strings

/* 
  Backtick strings are also called template strings
  As the name suggests, you can now use backticks to create strings
  New features:
    - Multi-line strings
    - String interpolation
*/

// Example 1: Multi-line strings
const threeLines = `
barnabus
boon
borthus
`
console.log(fewLines);
// Notice how it would be different from a single/double quote string?
// Compare and contrast

// Example 2: String Interpolation
const name = "Daniel Boon",
  greeting = `Howdy ${name}`;

console.log(greeting);
