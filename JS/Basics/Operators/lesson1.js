// Operators and Operands

/*
  In javascript, operators are special functions that work in their own ways
  Think of operators as symbols that do specific tasks (special functions)
  Think of operands as the things operands do things with (parameters)
*/

// Example 1: basic operator and operands
1 + 2; // in this case, 1 and 2 are operands. The '+' symbol is the operator

/*
  Javascript supports the following types of operators:
    Arithmetic
    Assignment
    Bitwise
    Comparison
    Comma
    Conditional(ternary)
    Logical
    Relational
    String
    Unary

// Try to think of a few operators you've seen in javascript
// What do they do?
// How are they different from normal functions?
