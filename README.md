# Organized JS

## Purpose

I firmly hold the belief that you need to write code to get good with writing code. These are my notes compiled in an organized format. 

Currently I'm only covering Javascript, but do plan on adding more later.

## To get the most out of my code

1. Look up the subject you're interested in
2. Run the code on a web/node console
3. When in doubt, review the documentation and play with the concept

## Where to start?

#### Regardless of where you are as a programmer, I recommend one of two things:

1. Start at JS/Basics/lesson1.js
2. Start at any topic's lesson1.js file (each folder follows the same layout)

## Want to help?

- Feel free to raise issues or nitpick
- If something is confusing, don't hesitate to point it out 
- Keep in mind that this is in the draft writing stage and there's currently a year or two of work left for content completion.

## TODO:

1. Formalize format
2. Finish Basics section
3. Finish Intermediate section
4. Finish Advanced section
5. Create problems (Homework) for each lesson
6. Explain what continue does and where to use it
