# Organized JS/HTML/CSS

The main purpose of this repository is to teach people how to better understand why Javascript works the way in a more simplified, yet detailed, manner.

There are potential multiple code snippets in each file. While you can copy and paste code into web browsers, a great way to learn is to write your own and test and play with it.

## To get the most out of my code

1. Look up the subject you're interested in
2. Run the code on a web/node console
3. If you get lost, or confused, remember that confusion is usually the step before understanding.
4. When in doubt, review the documentation and play with the concept

Feel free to raise issues with this. This is in the writing stage and there's currently a few months to a year of work left.
