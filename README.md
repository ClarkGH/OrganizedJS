# Organized JS/HTML/CSS

##Purpose

These are my notes compiled in order regarding subjects I feel people should play with to fully understand.

## To get the most out of my code

1. Look up the subject you're interested in
2. Run the code on a web/node console
3. When in doubt, review the documentation and play with the concept

Feel free to raise issues with this. This is in the writing stage and there's currently a few months to a year of work left.
